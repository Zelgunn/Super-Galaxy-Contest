# Super Galaxy Contest

[The game](#the-game)

Project realised in two weeks with Emilien Grude, Thibaud Serre, Quentin Boucher and Thomas Chantelose. I wrote all the code for this project.  
Super Galaxy Contest was made for the [Virtual Fantasy contest] (https://www.laval-virtual.org/en/prices-competitions/virtual-fantasy/presentation-vf-en.html)at Laval Virtual 2016, and was awarded with the price of Interaction.

The game
========
In short, Super Galaxy Contest is a football game played with two players in each team, with a bit of "Capture the Flag".
Each player is the team has a unique role, a player can either be the "Snooper" or the "Roamer".
Roamers focus their attention of the ball, snooper focus their on the flag.  
Roamers have to both defend the goal and score goals. Snoopers have to take the flag and bring it back to their Roamer, if the other Snooper has the flag, the Snooper can tackle him to make him drop the flag.  
Each goal is worth 5 points and each flag brought to the Roamer is worth 1 point. Each flag brought to the Roamer also allows the Roamer to use special abilities. These abilities can either improve an ally or weak an ennemy for a very short time.  
While the Snooper is played with an usual controller, Roamers are controlled with a Novint Falcon, an haptic device, as you can see in the video.
